    <p>Ah, like every day I see<br>
    Another day repeats, I'm yawning all the time<br>
    After all the cheers, the night, it fades out and<br>
    Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light<br>
    And somehow, an emptiness surrounds<br>
    That's what I always feel<br>
    Something is not enough<br>
    That's how it's gonna be<br>
    It's all a part of life<br>
    I'll let this be<br>
<br>
    See what, see what, covered deep inside<br>
    Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on<br>
    Pretending won't bring it out of sight<br>
    It is always waiting there for you<br>
<br>
    Calling followed, what I feel's to be drawn<br>
    Going by my selection in this color, then<br>
    Suddenly, with the breeze of a drowsy morning<br>
    There was a world of blue shown in front of me<br>
    Liking what you believe in and saying that you do<br>
    Can be too terrifying, but I know<br>
    I've finally come across a true discovery of what I got<br>
<br>
    Ah, the more that I reach out my hands to what I need<br>
    The further it becomes<br>
    Another one of these unruly days go on<br>
    I'm always in a hurry as I'm struggling<br>
    Misery, stemming from all my thoughts<br>
    Humiliation brings new tears into my view<br>
    The more that I step in, the harder it becomes<br>
    Even the pain renews<br>
<br>
    Calling followed, what I feel is the move<br>
    Going by my selection in this path I walk<br>
    On a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy<br>
    I'm grabbing tight, the blue vow in front of me<br>
    Taking what you believe and to keep doing so<br>
    Every step's not only fun all the time<br>
    Don't know if I'm able, cause I am worried a little<br>
<br>
    Ah, "one line" was drawn<br>
    Every "one line" was drawn<br>
    Missing inner confidence, I've drawn all pages I could draw<br>
    Ah, "one time" becomes<br>
    Every "one time" becomes<br>
    Soon, a large accumulation of a strength inside of you<br>
    All around, I look at them<br>
    Comparing what I do with them<br>
    What is it only I can do that nobody else can?<br>
    Even if I've got no true confidence, I'm moving on<br>
<br>
    Covered in thoughts and emotion within<br>
    Unknown to me, a brand new feeling<br>
    And, on the day I took the step for the first time<br>
    Including even this, new pain that I felt too<br>
    Liking what I believe in and facing it led<br>
    To a touch of the preview of a light <br>
    Gonna be alright, let us go<br>
    All I can do now is to have the fun<br>
<br>
    Everything is on the line as I draw<br>
    Using my own unique usage of colors and<br>
    Every dawn, every night, I would keep on running<br>
    And now I found the blue glowing light on me<br>
    Liking what you believe in and facing it too<br>
    Can be still terrifying but now I know<br>
    No longer am I these versions of me living in transparency<br>
    Now I know how to be my precious incomparable new self<br>
<br>
    See what, see what, covered deep inside<br>
    Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on<br>
    Pretending won't bring it out of sight<br>
    It is always waiting there, still always waiting there for you and<br>
    See what, see what, covered deep inside<br>
    Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on<br>
    Pretending won't bring it out of sight<br>
    It is always waiting there, waiting inside of you</p>
